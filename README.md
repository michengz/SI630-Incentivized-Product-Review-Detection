# SI650-Incentivized-Product-Review-Detection
NLP Course Final Project @ University of Michigan
## Overview
As people have increasingly relied on online product reviews to make purchasing decisions nowadays, the problem of companies using incentivized reviews to boost brand exposures have continued to rise, especially in the beauty product industry. This project aims to perform text classification to identify incentivized product reviews on the Sephora website by using traditional linear models such as Logistic Regression and SVM, as well as more complexed deep learning models such as LSTM and BERT.
