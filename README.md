# SI650-Incentivized-Product-Review-Detection
NLP Course Final Project @ University of Michigan
## Overview
As consumers increasingly rely on online product reviews to make informed purchasing decisions, the use of incentivized reviews by companies to boost brand exposures has become a growing concern. This is particularly prevalent in the beauty industry, where platforms such as Influenster and PINCHme offer free beauty product samples in exchange for users leaving positive reviews on websites such as Sephora. To address this issue, this project aims to employ text classification techniques to identify incentivized product reviews on the Sephora website. The study will utilize various machine learning models, including traditional linear models like Logistic Regression and SVM, as well as advanced deep learning models like LSTM and BERT.
